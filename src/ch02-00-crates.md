# OrbTK Crate Structure

While developing OrbTK, we try to take care of some basic principles

* modularity
* extensibility
* multiplatfom awareness

Within the Rust ecosystem, `crates` are a natural way to distinct those code

By the time writing this overview, OrbTK will provide the following crate:

* api
* localization
* render
* shell
* theme
* theming
* tree
* utils
* widget

We will discuss their meanings step by step in the following chapters
